```
npm run test
```

#### Port configuration

Turbo will attempt to test components in parallel which will lead to port conflicts.

Setting the `concurrency` to `1` will prevent Turbo from running tests in parallel:

```
"test": "turbo run test --concurrency=1",
```

`turbo.json`does not support `--concurrency` yet. See [this issue](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/discussions/7493).
